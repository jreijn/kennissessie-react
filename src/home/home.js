                Our developer conference is a platform where you and your colleagues can share knowledge with
                like-minded IT specialists. We will focus on trends and the latest software development technologies.
                Multiple technical sessions will be presented by renowned international and national speakers who will
                also share their experience and knowledge through a series of parallel sessions.
                <br/><br/>
                Check out the agenda to build your own conference learning experience. In between the sessions we offer
                15 minutes breaks so there is some time to chat amongst speakers or fellow attendees, and to grab a cup
                of coffee or tea. There is no need to rush from one session to the next. The cinema rooms all offer
                spacious and comfortable seats and a big screen to follow along.
                <br/><br/>
                Meet people, ask questions, exchange your experiences and explore the future together. Enjoy this
                learning experience at Luminisâ€™ DevCon; the developers conference of the year!
